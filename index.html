            <h2>What's happening? I'm Gavin McKinney.</h2>
            <p>Up until I was 17-18 I was considerably overweight, around 3-4 stone or 20-30kg overweight roughly.
                I did in fact lose the weight from the ages of 18 to 22 multiple times but always put it back on - every 6 months people would get a shock at a party cause they were either getting 'multiple chins Gav' or 'skinny as a rake Gav' depending on which part of the extreme dieting cycle they were catching me on.
                I would convince myself another 5-10 pounds would do the job - continue to restrict myself until I couldn't do it anymore then I'd go off the rails for months. 
                No matter what I weighed on the scale I would step off it, look in the mirror and still hate how I looked.
                I had dabbled in the gym but never really bothered to learn anything - I would go with mates for a while and I'd usually just follow what they do. </p>

        <h2>This is how to get results.</h2>
        <p>I then came across a guy called Kinobody on Youtube - now this guy is the opposite of me. You would probably call him arrogant, self obsessed and potentially pretty snake oil salesmany. 

            However when it came to lifting he taught me a lot, I liked how straight to the point he was off and I decided to take the leap and spend around Â£35 on a programme from him which at 22 probably emptied my bank account haha.
            
            This was the beginning of me following something and seeing progress. I started to track my lifts, I started to pay attention to making progress and most importantly I started to turn up consistently instead of just when my mates were going and could give me a lift cause I couldn't drive. 
            
            Every week it got easier to not want to miss a session cause every week I could see in my lifts I was improving because I was looking at the number I could lift on a given exercise rather than the numbers on a scale - it was so much more satisfying and so much healthier for my mind and body.

            After 8 weeks for the first time in my life I started to build belief that I could do something and stick to it - I wasn't a failure.
            That was my story and that's what led me to become a coach, I knew if I could do it from that starting point then I would be able to help others.

       <h2>How Tom went from downing JaegarBombs to being in the best shape of his life.</h2>
       <img src="./images/tom1.jpg">
       <p> I first met Tom travelling in Asia before I was a personal trainer. This was a crazy time in our lives, one night Tom actually won a drinking competition. Knocking back 49 Jagerbombs in one night.
        Yes. 49!  
        
        </p>
        <div class="tom-story-2">
        <img src="./images/tom text.jpg">
        <p>Two years later I announce on Instagram during Lockdown that I am becoming a personal trainer - I had seriously started to change my life around and I wanted to help other people. 

        I wanted to take on some online clients for free just to show people I knew what I was talking about - when Tom reached out saying he wanted to transform his lockdown bod I sort of chuckled to myself and thought there is no way this guy can do it. 
        After a few sticky weeks things slowly started to come together - Tom had previously leaned down from running but looked more 'skinny' and had never built some shape and muscle before. He thought more fat loss was the answer to fix his relationship with his body. 

        A cycle I knew all too well myself of thinking being as skinny as possible would fix my hatred for my body.
        
        He had a full on home gym set up with a squat rack, benches, heavy dumbbells the lot - so I said to him let's teach you how to lift and it will change your life.
        
        After an apprehensive start we started making some noticeable differences and as soon as he started sending me video's excited that his deadlift had increased instead of his scale weight I knew we were onto something, this is the exact change that happened in my head. </p>
      </div>
       <h2>Fast forward 4 months and Tom to this day is probably one of the craziest transformations I have ever gotten.</h2>

        </div>
        <p> Sarah found it a bit overwhelming to start the gym, tracking food and taking progress pictures and measurements all at the same time.
            So what we actually did was start on 7000 steps a day, tracking food and hitting a protein target.
            That was enough to get the ball rolling and build her confidence.
            From there we started lifting from home 3 times a week with adjustable dumbbells - I build these adjustable dumbbells programmes in a way in which you could easily do it in the gym with the dumbbells in there.
            After 6 or 7 weeks off her own accord Sarah asked if she could try the gym.. With no pressure from myself she started her sessions in there and the next week I put a gym programme in.
            6 months later she is 15kg down, deadlifting 50kg for reps with unreal form.</p>
